# LibrariesForFasterEDA
EDA can be performed faster with the hep of few libraries such as SweetViz, PandasProfiling, D-Tale, Vaex etc. This Repository consists files which has sample implementation of such libraries.

We perform EDA on our dataset then calculate the fundamental calculation from the data using graphs and plots. Mostly, we use python language for coding scripts of machine learning and there is a huge number of libraries available for performing exploratory data analysis, some of the most used libraries are matplotlib, pyplot, bokeh, seaborn, etcâ€¦

On top of these, libraries are built and implemented for faster automated EDA.

The Repository includes:

1. SweetViz:
2. PandasProfiling:
3. DTale:
4. DataPrep:
5. Vaxe:


Vizualize:
1. Pandas Vizual Analysis
2. Auto Viz
